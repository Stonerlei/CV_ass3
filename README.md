By using SIFT, we can extract features from images, after that, feature alignment between images can be achieved.
In this project, SIFT feature points of one image are captured and paired with their best counterparts in another image. 
In doing so, homogeneous matrix from image A to image B can be predicted using RANSAC and least square, with those pairs as known points.
